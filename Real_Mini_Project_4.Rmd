An important aspect of data science is collecting data accurately, so that it can be analyzed accurately. With a focus of ethics being highlighted last week, accurate data entry was our focus.

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(mdsr)
library(RMySQL)
db <- dbConnect_scidb(dbname = "imdb")
```

```{r, include = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(dbplyr)
library(knitr)
library(ggthemes)
library(htmltools)
library(vembedr)
```

The base data collected from SQL was the same used in the previous mini project.

```{r}
sql_genre_data <- db %>%
dbGetQuery("SELECT mi.info, 
t.title, t.production_year, t.id
FROM title t
JOIN movie_info mi ON t.id = mi.movie_id
WHERE mi.info_type_id = 3
AND t.kind_id = 1;")
```

```{r}
genre_count <- sql_genre_data %>%
  group_by(production_year, id) %>%
  summarise(genres_observed = n()) %>%
  filter(production_year < 2018)

genre_max_and_avg_count <- genre_count %>%
  group_by(production_year) %>%
  summarise(max_genre_count = max(genres_observed), average_genre_count = mean(genres_observed))
```

We wanted to us the movies with the highest number of recorded votes in  1940, 1960, 1980, and 2000.

```{r}
sql_1940_data <- db %>%
dbGetQuery("SELECT t.title, t.production_year, 
mi.movie_id,
mii.info_type_id, mii.info 
FROM title t
LEFT JOIN movie_info mi ON mi.movie_id = t.id
LEFT JOIN movie_info mi2 ON mi2.movie_id = t.id
LEFT JOIN movie_info_idx mii ON mii.movie_id = t.id
WHERE kind_id = 1 AND production_year = 1940
  AND mi.info_type_id = 1 AND mi2.info = 'USA'
  AND mii.info_type_id = 100
  AND mii.info > 100000
  ORDER BY mii.info DESC;")

sql_1960_data <- db %>%
dbGetQuery("SELECT t.title, t.production_year, 
mi.movie_id,
mii.info_type_id, mii.info 
FROM title t
LEFT JOIN movie_info mi ON mi.movie_id = t.id
LEFT JOIN movie_info mi2 ON mi2.movie_id = t.id
LEFT JOIN movie_info_idx mii ON mii.movie_id = t.id
WHERE kind_id = 1 AND production_year = 1960
  AND mi.info_type_id = 1 AND mi2.info = 'USA'
  AND mii.info_type_id = 100
  AND mii.info > 100000
  ORDER BY mii.info DESC;")

sql_1980_data <- db %>%
dbGetQuery("SELECT t.title, t.production_year, 
mi.movie_id,
mii.info_type_id, mii.info 
FROM title t
LEFT JOIN movie_info mi ON mi.movie_id = t.id
LEFT JOIN movie_info mi2 ON mi2.movie_id = t.id
LEFT JOIN movie_info_idx mii ON mii.movie_id = t.id
WHERE kind_id = 1 AND production_year = 1980
  AND mi.info_type_id = 1 AND mi2.info = 'USA'
  AND mii.info_type_id = 100
  AND mii.info > 100000
  ORDER BY mii.info DESC;")

sql_2000_data <- db %>%
dbGetQuery("SELECT t.title, t.production_year, 
mi.movie_id,
mii.info_type_id, mii.info

  AND mii.info > 100000
  ORDER BY mii.info DESC;")
```

```{r}
movie_genre_info <- sql_genre_data %>%
  filter(id == 4361365 | id == 4118523 | id == 4260164| id == 3944746)

genres_info <- movie_genre_info %>%
  group_by(production_year, title) %>%
  summarize(Genre = paste(info, collapse = ',')) 
```
According to the article in the Atlantic, "How Netflix Reversed Engineered Hollywood", Netflix uses 76,847 micro-genres or unique ways to describe types of movies. [^1] With choices like that, it's no surprise that "Netflix and Chill" has become a popular way for young people to pass the time. As platforms like Netflix and Hulu continue to increase their ability to individualistically categorize movies by hyperspecific genres, the relevance of IMDb will further deplenish.   

Because streaming platforms like Netflix, a go to website for movie watchers, offer distinct genres for their movies, IMDb genre categorizations often conflict with the expectations of audiences. We explore these inconsistencies, and a few others, and possible consequences for IMDb, if the problem is not resolved.

Research on IMDb shows that the average number of genres recorded for movies has stayed relatively consistent over the decades. 
```{r, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(genre_max_and_avg_count, aes()) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = production_year, y = average_genre_count), size = 1.5) +
  ggtitle("Average Number of Genres\nRecorded By IMDb") +
  scale_x_continuous("Production Year", limits = c(1940,2000), breaks = c(1940, 1960, 1980, 2000)) +
  scale_y_continuous("Average Recorded", breaks = c(1, 2, 3)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 20, face = "bold"), 
    axis.ticks.length = unit(0.25, "cm"),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 15), 
    legend.text = element_text(size = 13),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 20),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 15)) +
  theme_wsj()
```

We aim to see if these numbers are an accurate representation of movie genre categorization.

```{r}
genres_info %>%
  head(4) %>%
  kable(caption = "IMDb Recorded Genres", 
        col.names = c("Production Year", "Movie", "Genres"), 
        align = "l",
        width = "2")
```

*The Great Dictator* was the most popular movie released in 1940, shortly after America became involved in WWII. Even though it was Charlie Chaplin's first talking picture, as well as his highest-grossing film, he admitted in his 1964 biography **“Had I known of the actual horrors of the German concentration camps, I could not have made. The Great Dictator, I could not have made fun of the homicidal insanity of the Nazis.”**[^2]

```{r}
embed_url("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sfJxdytYn4")
```


Within the first few seconds of a trailer for *The Great Dictator*, we can see that the movie has the characteristics to be a political-satire. Chaplin’s comedic chops are used to bring light to the atrocities happenings in Germany. *The Great Dictator* is listed in IMDb under the genres: comedy, drama, and war. While not entirely inaccurate, seeing how it is a comedy and a war is taking place, these genre pairings don't explain the overall tone of the movie. A categorization like political-satire gives a better description of the film's propaganda and political commentary on the war. 



Alfred Hitchcock's *Psycho* is the most popular highest ranking movie of 1960 on IMDb, with 8.5 out of 10 stars and over 476,052 votes. **"In the time the genre was created, the slasher film was a huge landmark in film history, starting with the 1960 film Psycho, known to be one of the greatest films of all time and starting a string of unique and great story telling, and new cinematic directions, with a very dark twist that started a revolutionary genre in film history."**[^3]

Even though Hitchcock is credited as a pioneer for the slasher genre, IMDb categorized the movie as: horror, thriller, and mystery. These genres may offer some insight on what viewers can expect to see when watching the movie, but undersells the amount of gore that is present in a slasher. 

*Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back* was the highest grossing film of 1980, and continues to exemplify the George Lucas series. There are actually two different IMDb categorizes this movie. In their data set, it is listed as: Action, Adventure, Fantasy, and Sci-Fi. However, on the actual IMDb website, Science Fiction is not included in the list of genres.

![Actual Poster from 1980](http://img.moviepostershop.com/the-empire-strikes-back-movie-poster-1980-1010466693.jpg)

The data in this data set is inaccurate when adding Sci-Fi to the list of genres for this movie. A Huffington Post article does a great job at illustrating the lack of science fiction that exists in the Star Wars Saga. **"Science fiction is in the business of exploring the way that human beings respond to challenges... But what makes a story science fiction is that the challenges are produced by or related to science and technology."**[^4]

Genres don't seem to be the only thing IMDb struggles with keep accurate though. The newest movie that was looked at was Christopher Nolan's *Momento*, which was the highest ranking movie of 2000 with the highest number of votes recorded in their database. However, it is important to note that the IMDb website had *Gladiator* higher on the list, since both had the score of an 8.5, but *Gladiator* has received a little more than 100,000 more votes than *Momento*. This movie also fails the genre test. IMDb categorizes this film as a mystery and thriller. Although this may seem accurate, these genres fail to capture the mind-bending complexity of this movie. A more fitting genre would be psychological thirller, which is what Netflix has listed on their website.

In the defense of IMDb, one alternate reason that could explain why the data is inaccurate and flat out is not reflective of what can be seen on line, is that the database we are using is dated. Maybe IMDb has a whole team of Data Scientists that are updating the data daily, however they don't release that information to the public so frequently. Another hypothesis is that, because our sample size is so small, we can not conclue for sure if our analysis holds an statistical significance.

With any research, it's important to be confident that the data you are working with is accurate. Because of limited time and resources, we not able to inspect the genre categorizations of the hundreds of thousands of movies that are recorded in the IMDb database. However, IMDb does and the should invest in reevaluating how they are categorizing their movies,in order to provide the most accurate description of a movie for the person that might be wanting that information on it. This is not only for the sake of the people using their website, but to help themselves keep up with other platforms, like Netflix, that aren't limiting themselves to only 24 genres.
